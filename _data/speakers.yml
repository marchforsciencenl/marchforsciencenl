          Appy Sluijs (1980) is the Professor of Paleoceanography at the Earth
          Sciences Department and co-chair of the research group Marine
          Palynology and Paleoceanography at Utrecht University. “My primary
          research interests include climate and ecological change in the
          geological past. My research particularly focuses on reconstructing
          temperature, marine ecology, hydrology, biogeochemical cycles and sea
          level during periods that were characterized by rapidly increasing, or
          generally high concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. Together with
          students and colleagues, I combine micropaleontological and
          geochemical (both inorganic and organic) techniques to quantify and
          understand the functioning of planet Earth under ‘greenhouse’
          conditions.”

          language faculty and how it is instantiated in the brain. In his
          research he applies neuroimaging techniques such as ERP, MEG, PET and
          fMRI to investigate the language system and its impairments as in
          aphasia, dyslexia and autism. For his scientific contributions, the
          Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts Sciences (KNAW) awarded him with the
          Hendrik Mullerprijs in 2003. In 2004 he was awarded by the Dutch Queen
