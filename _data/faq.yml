- question-en: What good does a March do?
  answer-en: |
          Marches can work. Historically, there is ample precedent for this.

          Violent protests are less effective. The pace of legislative action is hindered by especially extreme protests. March for Science Los Angeles endeavors to promote a peaceful call to action and celebration of science.

          Large numbers work better. The necessary sequence of action is; March -> Media -> Policy. For policymakers to take note of an issue it must first be noteworthy to the media. Large numbers drive the media's interest and effect change.

- question-en: What do I need to know about signs?

When thinking about the content for your sign, themes around our goals will create unity. Please remember this is a nonpartisan, family friendly event.
