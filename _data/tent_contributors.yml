          __Dr. Arnold van Vliet__ is specialised in the development and coordination of citizen science networks. The main network is the Dutch phenological network Nature's Calendar ([www.natuurkalender.nl](http://www.natuurkalender.nl)) that aims to monitor, analyse, predict and communicate the timing of life cycle events like e.g. the start of flowering, appearance of butterflies and the arrival of migratory birds. Nature's Calendar network aims to help society to adapt to climate change ecological impacts. Other examples of citizen science networks that he coordinates are the Mosquito Radar ([www.muggenradar.nl](http://www.muggenradar.nl)), Allergy Radar (www.allergieradar.nl), Tick Radar (www.tekenradar.nl) and the GrowApp (www.growapp.today). Furthermore, Van Vliet is specialized in communicating science to society. He coordinates the nature news website NatureToday.com where over fifteen nature organisations publish two nature reports per day on current developments in nature in The Netherlands. Nature Today aims to bring nature into the news domain to increase the interest of society in nature.
